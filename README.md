# Learning Image Synthesis with OpenGL
**Amad Salmon | 2021**  
Based on <a href="http://www-evasion.imag.fr/Membres/Georges-Pierre.Bonneau/">Prof Georges-Pierre Bonneau</a>'s "Synthèse d'Image" course at Polytech Grenoble.  
  
This repository is mainly made for university. It is organized in six 'TPs' (<i>lab</i> in English) folders, each of which containing a `Rapport.pdf` or `README.md` file that  a report on the work led during the corresponding lab, and that shows screenshots of the resulting generated images.  

The labs grow in difficulty, starting with the basics of image synthesis (rendering simple shapes and colors), and end covering more complex notions like the use of shaders, textures or fractals.
